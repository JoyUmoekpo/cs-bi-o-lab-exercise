# Big-O Complexity
In today's lab you will practice your assessment of code and improve performance of that code by writing code with better time and space complexity.

## Instructions
For todayâ€™s lab, please download the provided material and open index.js.

Once open, please walk through each problem. If you are unsure about what a block of code is doing, copy and paste it into a replit.

Once you have finished the core problems, please push your code to GitHub. Spend the remainder of your lab exercise time working on your capstone project.
